# ALX-ZERO_DAY/0X03-git

This [README](./README.md) continues the documentation from the [last README](../README.md).

In this directory:
1. I created [this folder](.)
2. I wrote this README.

> NOTE: I want to state from here that all steps are finally added, committed and pushed to this repository.

3. I created the folders [bash](./bash), [c](./c) and js and added files ([bash/alx](./bash/alx), [bash/school](./bash/school), [c/c_is_fun.c](./c/c_is_fun.c), ...) as instructed.
4. I created the `update_script` branch, created the [bash/98](./bash/98) file, edited the bash/alx in this branch(update_script).
5. I edited the bash/alx and bash/school files and delete the js folder with its content.
6. I edited this README on the Github web UI.
